The app is a simplified version of the famous Instagram app.

__In this app you have 5 screens__: * Login Screen
                                    * Newsfeed Screen
                                    * Add a post Screen
                                    * Bucketlist Screen
                                    * Profile Screen
                                    
__For the sake of testing the app:__
In Login Screen: 
  * login with email: 123456789@test.com password: 123456789
  OR
  * login with email: abcdefg@test.com password: abcdefg
  __N.B:__ These two profiles will be the only available users and we will assume that they follow each other. So both of them will see the others' posts in his Newsfeed.
